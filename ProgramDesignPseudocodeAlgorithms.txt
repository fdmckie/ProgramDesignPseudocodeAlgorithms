Problem #1

Input: 

-	Individual Test Score(s)

Process: 

-	Counter (Increment)
-	Tally Test Scores

Output: 

-	Average Test Score


Pseudocode:

* Initialize Counter
* While Counter <= 10 (Total # of Test Scores to be computed)
	- Prompt user to enter test score
	- Tally Total Test Score(s)
	- Add 1 to Counter (Increment by 1)
	- Compute Average Test Score (Total Test Score divided by Counter) [Counter will ultimately be 10]


Problem #2

Input: 

- Dimensions of Roof (in feet)

Process:

- Convert Dimensions of Roof into inches
- Multiply Dimensions of Roof (in inches) by Rainfall (in inches) to 
  Compute Water Runoff (in cubic inches)

Output:

- Water Runoff (in Gallons)


Pseudocode

* Enter Dimensions of Roof (in feet)
* Convert Dimensions of Roof into inches (Multiply by 12 for each dimension)
* Enter Inches of Rainfall
* Compute Water Runoff from roof (in cubic inches) [Multiply Dimensions of Roof (in inches) by Inches of Rainfall]
* Compute Water Runoff from roof (in gallons) [Divide Water Runoff from roof (in cubic inches) by 231]
