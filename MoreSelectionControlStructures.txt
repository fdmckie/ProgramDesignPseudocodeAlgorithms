Problem #2: Calculate Employee's Pay


Input: 

-	Employee Number
- 	Pay Rate
-	# of Hours Worked In Week

Process: 

	- Validate Pay Rate
	- Validate Hours Worked
	- If Pay Rate or Hours Worked is not validated, do not compute Weekly Pay and print appropriate message
	- If Pay Rate and Hours Worked is validated
		- If Hours Worked > 35 hours compute Normal Weekly Pay + Overtime Pay
		- If Hours Worked < 35 hours compute Normal Weekly Pay

Output:

- 	Employee Number
- 	Hours Worked
-	Pay Rate
-	Weekly Pay for Employee Number



Pseudocode:

* Read Employee Number
* Read Pay Rate
* Read Hours Worked

*	Validate Pay Rate
*	Vadliate Hours Worked
		For Validation:
			-	Maximum Hours Worked (60 hours)
			-	Maximum Hourly Rate ($25.00/hour)
		If not Validated (Max. Hours Worked or Maximum Hourly Rate is exceeded):
			-	Employee Weekly Pay will not be calculated
			-	Print appropriate message
		If Validated:
			- Compute Weekly Pay
				If Hours Worked <= 35
					- Weekly Pay = Hours Worked * Pay Rate
				If Hours Worked > 35
					- Overtime Pay = (Hours Worked - 35) * (Pay Rate * 1.5)
					- Weekly Pay = (35 * Pay Rate) + Overtime Pay
		
* For Output:
	* Print Employee Number
	* Print Hours Worked
	* Print Pay Rate
